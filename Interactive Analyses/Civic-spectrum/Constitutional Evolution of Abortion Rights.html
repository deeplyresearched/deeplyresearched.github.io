    <!-- Chosen Palette: "Calm Neutral & Legal Blue" -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA is expanded to a 12-section horizontal tab-based navigation. This retains the original logical flow (Overview, Roe, Casey, Dobbs) while adding 7 new thematic sections. These new sections ("The Dobbs Arguments," "Key Cases Post-Roe," "Funding & Consent Cases," "Legal Standards Explained," "The 'Liberty' Debate," "Impact & Dissent," "Key Concepts (Glossary)") directly address the user's request for more depth and are derived from the report data. This structure allows a user to do a quick chronological review or dive deep into specific themes (like funding, legal theory, or post-Roe case law). The "Legal Standards Explained" section is a new, dedicated, detailed-text section to satisfy the user's specific request for elaboration on key concepts, while the original "Key Concepts" is retitled as a "Glossary" for quick reference. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices:
    1. Report Info: Chronological history (1973, 1992, 2022). Goal: Orient user. Viz/Presentation: Interactive horizontal timeline (HTML/Tailwind). Interaction: Clickable nodes for each case (Roe, Casey, Dobbs) activate the corresponding content tab. Justification: Provides immediate visual context and navigation. Method: HTML/Tailwind/JS. (Existing)
    2. Report Info: Shift in legal standards & state power (Roe vs. Casey vs. Dobbs). Goal: Compare/Change. Viz/Presentation: A dynamic Bar Chart (Chart.js) titled "Evolution of State Regulatory Power". Interaction: Chart displays three bars showing the relative level of state power under each ruling. Justification: Visually quantifies the abstract concept of 'state power' evolving. Method: Chart.js (Canvas). (Existing)
    3. Report Info: Roe's Trimester Framework. Goal: Organize/Explain. Viz/Presentation: 3-column card layout (HTML/Tailwind) titled "The Trimester Framework". Interaction: Static display. Justification: Clearly segments the three distinct legal trimesters established by Roe. Method: HTML/Tailwind. (Existing)
    4. Report Info: Core arguments of Dobbs (Majority vs. Dissent). Goal: Compare. Viz/Presentation: Side-by-side comparison (HTML/Tailwind) in "The Dobbs Arguments" tab. Interaction: Static text. Justification: Directly contrasts the opposing legal arguments, which is central to the user's query. Method: HTML/Tailwind. (New Section)
    5. Report Info: Intermediate cases (Danforth, Akron, Webster, etc.). Goal: Inform/Change. Viz/Presentation: Chronological list in "Key Cases Post-Roe" tab. Interaction: Static text. Justification: Shows the gradual legal "chipping away" at Roe before Casey. Method: HTML/Tailwind. (New Section)
    6. Report Info: Funding/Consent cases (Maher, Harris, Matheson). Goal: Organize/Inform. Viz/Presentation: Thematic list in "Funding & Consent Cases" tab. Interaction: Static text. Justification: Groups a specific, recurring type of legal challenge. Method: HTML/Tailwind. (New Section)
    7. Report Info: Detailed definitions of legal standards. Goal: Inform/Explain. Viz/Presentation: Detailed text paragraphs in "Legal Standards Explained" tab. Interaction: Static text. Justification: Fulfills user's specific request for a detailed section on concepts. Method: HTML/Tailwind. (New Section)
    8. Report Info: Interpretation of "Liberty". Goal: Compare/Explain. Viz/Presentation: Text with blockquotes in "The 'Liberty' Debate" tab. Interaction: Static text. Justification: Explores the core philosophical/legal disagreement between Roe and Dobbs. Method: HTML/Tailwind. (New Section)
    9. Report Info: Dobbs dissent and future implications. Goal: Inform. Viz/Presentation: Text with bullet points in "Impact & Dissent" tab. Interaction: Static text. Justification: Explains the dissent's reasoning and the broader impact of the Dobbs ruling. Method: HTML/Tailwind. (New Section)
    10. Report Info: Key legal terms. Goal: Inform/Organize. Viz/Presentation: Accordion-style list in "Key Concepts (Glossary)" tab. Interaction: Click to expand/collapse. Justification: Provides a quick reference glossary, distinct from the new detailed section. Method: HTML/Tailwind/JS. (Existing, modified)

                    This section provides a high-level overview of the 49-year trajectory of the constitutional right to abortion in the United States. It began with its establishment as a fundamental right in <i>Roe v. Wade</i>, evolved and was partially eroded by the "undue burden" standard in <i>Planned Parenthood v. Casey</i>, and was ultimately overturned in <i>Dobbs v. Jackson</i>, which returned regulatory power to individual states.

                    In 1973, <i>Roe v. Wade</i> established a nationwide, fundamental right to abortion. The Supreme Court ruled that a woman's right to make this decision was protected by the 14th Amendment's Due Process Clause, which guarantees a "right to privacy." This decision invalidated many state laws that had criminalized abortion.

                    <p class="text-stone-700 mb-6">To balance the individual's privacy right with the state's interest in maternal health and potential life, the Court created a three-part framework based on pregnancy trimesters.</p>

                    <p class="text-stone-700">The right was deemed "fundamental," which meant that any state law restricting it was subject to **"Strict Scrutiny,"** the highest level of judicial review. This required the state to prove it had a "compelling interest" and that the law was "narrowly tailored" to achieve that interest. This was a very high bar for states to meet.</p>

                    In 1992, <i>Planned Parenthood v. Casey</i> was a pivotal moment of both evolution and erosion. The Court, in a plurality opinion, faced a direct challenge to <i>Roe</i> but chose a middle path. It explicitly reaffirmed <i>Roe's</i> "central holding"—the constitutional right to an abortion before viability—but simultaneously dismantled the legal framework that protected it.

                    <p class="text-stone-700">This was a significant "erosion" because it lowered the bar for state regulations. As long as a restriction did not create a "substantial obstacle," it was permitted.

                    In 2022, <i>Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization</i> directly addressed a Mississippi law banning most abortions after 15 weeks.

                    <p class="text-stone-700">The Court's majority opinion, authored by Justice Alito, declared that the Constitution does not confer a right to abortion. The decision explicitly stated that <i>Roe</i> and <i>Casey</i> "must be overruled" because they were "egregiously wrong" and their reasoning was "exceptionally weak."</p>
                    <p class="text-stone-700 mt-4">The immediate effect of this ruling was the dissolution of nearly 50 years of federal constitutional protection for abortion. The authority to regulate or ban abortion was "returned to the people and their elected representatives," meaning the issue is now decided on a state-by-state basis. The legal standard for reviewing abortion laws was lowered from <i>Casey's</i> "undue burden" to the far weaker "rational-basis review."</p>

                    This section provides a detailed elaboration of the key legal standards that defined the 50-year arc of abortion law. The shift from "Strict Scrutiny" to "Undue Burden" and finally to "Rational Basis" represents the core of the legal evolution and erosion of the right.

                        <p class="text-stone-700">This is the highest and most difficult standard in constitutional law. When <i>Roe v. Wade</i> declared abortion a "fundamental right," it automatically triggered this test for any law that tried to restrict it. To be constitutional, the state had to prove two things: (1) it had a "compelling state interest" (like protecting maternal health or potential life at viability) and (2) the law was "narrowly tailored" to achieve that interest, meaning it was the least restrictive means possible. This high bar is why most pre-viability abortion restrictions were struck down for 19 years.</p>

                        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-blue-800 mb-2">2. The Undue Burden Standard (The <i>Casey</i> Standard)</h3>
                        <p class="text-stone-700"><i>Planned Parenthood v. Casey</i> explicitly rejected <i>Roe's</i> rigid trimester framework and its "strict scrutiny" test. In its place, the Court created this new, weaker standard. A law was now unconstitutional *only if* it placed a "substantial obstacle" in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before viability. This was the great "erosion": it meant states *could* regulate abortion (e.g., with 24-hour waiting periods, mandatory counseling) as long as those regulations didn't amount to a "substantial obstacle." The Court found that informing a woman and making her wait 24 hours was not a substantial obstacle, but forcing her to notify a potentially abusive husband was.</p>

                        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-blue-800 mb-2">3. The "Deeply Rooted in History" Test (The <i>Dobbs</i> Justification)</h3>
                        <p class="text-stone-700">This is not a standard of review, but rather the test the <i>Dobbs</i> majority used to *remove* the right entirely. To be protected under the 14th Amendment's "liberty" clause, the Court said a right must be "deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition." The majority looked at US law in 1868 (when the 14th Amendment was ratified) and found that most states criminalized abortion. They concluded that because the right wasn't "deeply rooted" in 19th-century history, it was not a valid constitutional right, and <i>Roe</i> and <i>Casey</i> had been "egregiously wrong" to invent it.</p>

                        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-blue-800 mb-2">4. Rational-Basis Review (The Post-<i>Dobbs</i> Standard)</h3>
                        <p class="text-stone-700">This is the lowest and easiest standard of review in constitutional law. By declaring that abortion is *not* a fundamental right, the <i>Dobbs</i> Court automatically lowered the standard for review to this level. Now, an abortion law will be upheld as long as the state can provide *any* "legitimate government interest" (like protecting "potential life" at any stage) and the law is "rationally related" to that interest. This gives state laws a "strong presumption of validity," making them very easy to defend and very difficult to challenge.</p>

                    <p class="text-stone-700 mb-4">The <i>Roe</i> court found that this "liberty" guarantee included a fundamental right to privacy, which covered personal decisions about family, marriage, contraception, and child-rearing.

                    <p class="text-stone-700 mb-4">The <i>Dobbs</i> majority rejected this broad view of "liberty." They argued that the 14th Amendment only protects rights that are either (1) explicitly mentioned in the Constitution or (2) "deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition." Since abortion was not explicitly mentioned and was criminalized in many states in 1868, they found it did not qualify.</p>
                    <p class="text-stone-700 mb-4">The majority opinion also argued that defining "liberty" as "autonomy" was too broad and dangerous, stating that such a definition would "license fundamental rights to illicit drug use, [or] prostitution."</h>
