    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application uses a fixed sidebar navigation to break the dense literary analysis into logical, thematic sections (Overview, Plot, Characters, Themes, Context, Engage). This non-linear structure allows users to explore content based on interest, which is more user-friendly than a long, linear document. Key interactions include a character relationship chart (Chart.js), an interactive plot timeline, and clickable cards for themes, all designed to encourage exploration and deeper understanding of the novel's complex elements. The goal is to transform a static report into an engaging educational tool. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Report Info: Core book details -> Goal: Inform -> Viz: HTML Table -> Interaction: Static -> Justification: Clear, concise presentation of factual data.
        - Report Info: Plot structure -> Goal: Organize/Change -> Viz: Interactive HTML/CSS Timeline -> Interaction: Click to reveal details -> Justification: Visualizes the narrative flow and makes a long summary digestible.
        - Report Info: Character relationships -> Goal: Relationships/Organize -> Viz: Bubble Chart -> Interaction: Hover/Click to see connection details -> Justification: Effectively maps the complex social web around the protagonist, offering a quick visual summary of influence and connection -> Library: Chart.js.
        - Report Info: Major Themes -> Goal: Inform/Organize -> Viz: HTML Cards -> Interaction: Click to expand -> Justification: Presents complex ideas in a clean, organized manner, allowing users to focus on one concept at a time.

                        Rodion Raskolnikov, an impoverished ex-student in St. Petersburg, formulates a theory that extraordinary individuals have the right to commit any crime. To prove his theory and solve his financial woes, he murders an old pawnbroker. Instead of liberation, the act plunges him into a feverish state of guilt, paranoia, and alienation. He is pursued not only by a cunning police investigator but by his own conscience, forcing him to confront the devastating consequences of his intellectual pride and seek redemption.

                        The setting of St. Petersburg is more than a backdrop; it's an active force in the novel. Dostoevsky portrays a city of stark contrasts: grand imperial facades hide squalid, overcrowded tenements. The oppressive summer heat, the stench of the streets, and the constant poverty mirror Raskolnikov's internal state of feverish delirium and claustrophobia. The city suffocates its inhabitants, fostering desperation, vice, and radical ideas, making it the perfect crucible for Raskolnikov's crime and subsequent punishment.

                            Dostoevsky's style is characterized by its intense psychological depth. He uses a limited third-person perspective that often blurs with Raskolnikov's own thoughts, creating a claustrophobic, feverish atmosphere. The prose is dense with philosophical dialogues, internal monologues, and dramatic, almost theatrical scenes. He employs stream of consciousness to immerse the reader in the protagonist's tormented mind, making the psychological punishment as real as any physical one.

                <p class="mb-8 text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">Beyond the main themes, "Crime and Punishment" is built upon a foundation of complex philosophical, psychological, and social ideas. This section elaborates on five of the most critical concepts Dostoevsky explores, providing a more profound understanding of the novel's intellectual and moral layers.</p>

                        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">1. Critique of Nihilism & Utilitarianism</h3>
                        <div class="card rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6">
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-loose">The novel is a direct response to the radical ideologies sweeping through Russia in the 1860s. Raskolnikov's "extraordinary man" theory is a perversion of these ideas. He adopts a nihilistic viewpoint—rejecting traditional morality and religion—and blends it with a crude form of utilitarianism, believing the murder of a "useless" old pawnbroker is justified if it leads to a greater good (his own career, helping the poor). Dostoevsky systematically dismantles this logic, demonstrating that abstract intellectual theories collapse when faced with the reality of human conscience and the sanctity of life. The novel argues that such ideologies lead not to liberation but to moral chaos and profound spiritual emptiness.</p>

                        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">2. The Psychology of Guilt and Paranoia</h3>
                        <div class="card rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6">
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-loose">Dostoevsky is a master of psychological realism, and the novel is a clinical study of a guilty conscience. Raskolnikov's punishment is not legal but internal. After the crime, he is plunged into a feverish state where his guilt manifests physically (illness, fainting) and mentally (paranoia, vivid nightmares, obsessive thoughts). He constantly fears exposure, scrutinizing every word and glance from others. His interactions with the investigator Porfiry Petrovich are masterful depictions of psychological warfare, where Porfiry uses Raskolnikov's own guilt as the primary tool of investigation, knowing that the mind of the criminal will ultimately betray him.</p>

                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-loose">Sonya Marmeladov represents the novel's spiritual core. While Raskolnikov relies on intellect and reason, which lead him to murder, Sonya relies on an unwavering Christian faith, which allows her to endure immense suffering with compassion and hope. She is the living antithesis of his theory. The path to redemption she offers is not logical but spiritual: it requires humility, confession, acceptance of suffering, and unconditional love. The pivotal scene where she reads him the story of Lazarus is central, symbolizing the possibility of spiritual resurrection for a man who is morally dead.</p>

                        <div class="card rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6">
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-loose">The novel is a stark portrayal of the squalor and desperation of 19th-century St. Petersburg. The city is a character in itself—a place of claustrophobic tenements, dirty streets, alcoholism, and crushing poverty. Dostoevsky uses the Marmeladov family to illustrate the devastating effects of these social conditions. This environment acts as an incubator for Raskolnikov's radical idea; his crime is born not just from intellectual pride but also from the desperation of his circumstances. The novel questions whether society itself is complicit in creating the conditions that lead individuals to crime.</p>

                        <div class="card rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6">
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-loose">Dostoevsky explores the idea that human nature is a battlefield of conflicting impulses. Raskolnikov himself is a prime example: he is both a cold-blooded murderer and a compassionate man who gives his last coins to the poor. He is driven by intellectual arrogance yet capable of deep love for his family. This duality is also explored through foils like Svidrigailov, who embodies a purely sensual and amoral existence but is also capable of acts of charity before his suicide. The novel suggests that every person contains the capacity for both great evil and profound good, and the moral struggle lies in which path is chosen.</p>

His works are renowned for their profound psychological depth and exploration of the human condition in the tumultuous political, social, and spiritual atmosphere of 19th-century Russia.</p>

                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-loose">Dostoevsky's life was as dramatic as his novels. As a young man, he was arrested for his involvement in a utopian socialist intellectual group. He and his fellow members were subjected to a mock execution, a traumatic event that deeply influenced his later work. He was then sentenced to four years of hard labor in a Siberian prison camp, an experience that shattered his youthful idealism and deepened his Christian faith. His writing is infused with themes of crime, guilt, free will, and the search for God, making him a foundational figure in existentialist thought.</p>

                            Written in the 1860s, "Crime and Punishment" reflects a period of immense social and intellectual change in Russia following the emancipation of the serfs in 1861. New, radical Western ideas like utilitarianism and nihilism were gaining popularity among the youth, questioning traditional morality and religion. Dostoevsky, who had himself been exiled to Siberia for his involvement with radical thinkers, wrote the novel as a cautionary tale against these ideologies. His personal experiences with poverty, epilepsy, and the Russian justice system deeply inform the novel's gritty realism and exploration of suffering.

Some praised its profound psychological insights, while others were shocked by its dark subject matter and perceived sympathy for radical ideas. Today, it is considered a masterpiece of world literature. Its deep dive into the human psyche influenced generations of writers and thinkers, including Nietzsche, Freud, and Camus, and it remains a foundational text in the study of psychology, existentialism, and moral philosophy.
