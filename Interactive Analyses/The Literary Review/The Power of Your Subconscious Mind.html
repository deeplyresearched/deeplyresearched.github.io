    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA is structured thematically to guide users from foundational concepts to practical applications. It begins with the core duality of the mind, moves to guiding principles, then offers a practical "workbench" for applying techniques to specific life areas, explores key metaphors, and concludes with the book's legacy. This non-linear, thematic approach is more intuitive for learning and application than a simple chapter-by-chapter summary, allowing users to explore based on their interests. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 1. Mind Duality Diagram (HTML/CSS): Goal is to inform. An interactive diagram shows the relationship between conscious and subconscious minds. Hover interactions provide details. Justification: Visualizes the book's most fundamental concept in a clear, engaging way. 2. Principles Explorer (JS-driven content switching): Goal is to organize. Users click buttons to reveal detailed text. Justification: Prevents information overload by breaking down dense principles into digestible, user-selected chunks. 3. Application Workbench (JS-driven filter): Goal is to provide practical tools. Users select a life area to see relevant techniques. Justification: A task-oriented design that lets users find actionable advice quickly. 4. Mind Power Chart (Chart.js Bar Chart): Goal is to compare abstract concepts. Visually represents the relative influence of different mental faculties. Justification: Simplifies a key argument of the book into an easy-to-grasp visual comparison. -->

                    <p class="max-w-3xl mx-auto text-lg text-gray-600">The book's central thesis is that you have one mind with two distinct functions: the conscious and the subconscious. Understanding their relationship is the key to unlocking your potential.</p>

                        <p>This is your reasoning, objective mind. It uses the five senses to perceive the world, makes decisions, and chooses your thoughts. Its primary job is to act as a "watchman at the gate," protecting the subconscious from false impressions.</p>

                        <p>This is your non-reasoning, subjective mind. It controls all bodily functions and emotions. It accepts any thought or belief your conscious mind impresses upon it as true and works tirelessly to bring it into your reality. It does not argue; it only acts.</p>

                        <p>This is the core theme that mental states directly create physical reality. It's not just positive thinking; it's the belief that your internal world of thought and feeling is the primary creative force, and the external world is a direct reflection or printout of it. Health, wealth, and events are seen as effects, with thought being the primary cause.</p>

                        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-[#81B29A] mb-3">Scientific Prayer</h3>
                        <p>Murphy redefines prayer not as supplication but as a deliberate and structured mental technique. It's 'scientific' because it's based on the predictable law of mind: what you impress on the subconscious will be expressed. It involves choosing a specific idea, feeling its reality, and releasing it with faith, trusting the subconscious to handle the 'how'.</p>

                        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-[#E07A5F] mb-3">The Law of Reversibility</h3>
                        <p>This principle states that just as your thoughts create your reality, you can change your reality by changing your thoughts. If a negative belief has created an undesirable condition, you can reverse it by instilling the opposite, positive belief. The mind is a creative medium, not a fixed state, meaning no condition is permanent if you change the mental cause behind it.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-600">This is a dynamic form of visualization. Instead of a static picture, you create a short mental film where you are the main actor. The film should feature you doing, having, or being what you desire. The most important part is the happy ending, which implies your problem is solved. Replay this movie often, especially before sleep.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-600">Gratitude is a powerful emotion that aligns you with universal forces. Before your prayer is answered, enter a state of thankfulness. Say "Thank you, Father" for the solution and the blessings you know are on their way. This state of grateful acceptance convinces the subconscious that the desire is already a reality.</p>

It does not matter if the thing believed is true or false; the subconscious accepts your belief as its command. This is why it's crucial to believe in positive outcomes, good fortune, and right action." },
                suggestion: { title: "The Power of Suggestion", content: "The subconscious is highly amenable to suggestion. You can use autosuggestion (affirming truths to yourself) to overwrite negative programming and instill positive beliefs. Suggestions gain power through repetition, faith, and expectancy. This is the primary tool for deliberately programming your mind." },
                imagination: { title: "Imagination Over Willpower", content: "Forcing an outcome with willpower often fails because it implies conflict. The key is to use disciplined imagination to feel the reality of the desired end result. A vivid mental picture, charged with the feeling of accomplishment, persuades the subconscious far more effectively than brute force or mental struggle." },

Feel the reality of this love." }, { name: "The Golden Rule", desc: "To solve a conflict, ask yourself: 'What would I want from this person?' Then, think, feel, and act towards them in that way. What you send out to another, you create in your own experience." }, { name: "Forgiveness", desc: "To heal a broken relationship, you must forgive yourself and the other person completely.

Key Point: The subconscious is impersonal and will grow seeds of success or failure with equal fidelity based on your habitual thinking." },
                { title: "3. The Miracle-Working Power of Your Subconscious", content: "Definition: The subconscious has the power to heal the body, solve problems, and attract resources.

                { title: "4. Mental Healings in Ancient Times", content: "Definition: Miraculous healings throughout history were not caused by the relic or person, but by the subject's own faith and belief activating their subconscious healing power.

Practical Techniques in Mental Healings", content: "Definition: A set of methods for impressing the subconscious, such as the 'pass-over' technique (affirming before sleep) and the 'thank-you' technique.

                { title: "7. The Tendency of the Subconscious Is Lifeward", content: "Definition: The natural impulse of the subconscious mind is toward health, harmony, and life. Key Point: Negative patterns are unnatural acquisitions. Aligning with the subconscious lifeward drive through positive thought promotes healing." },
                { title: "8. How to Get the Results You Want", content: "Definition: Getting results depends on avoiding conflict between your conscious desire and your subconscious belief. Key Point: Coercion or willpower fails. Success comes from imagination and feeling, which persuades the subconscious without force." },
                { title: "9. How to Use the Power of Your Subconscious for Wealth", content: "Definition: Wealth is a state of consciousness. Consistently dwelling on ideas of abundance and success programs the subconscious to attract them. Key Point: Never criticize wealth. Feel the reality of being wealthy now to make it manifest." },
                { title: "10. Your Right to Be Rich", content: "Definition: It is a cosmic right to live an abundant life. Poverty is a mental disease caused by a belief in lack.

                { title: "14. Your Subconscious Mind and Marital Problems", content: "Definition: Marital friction stems from projecting negative thoughts and resentments. Harmony is achieved by radiating love, peace, and goodwill. Key Point: To have a good partner, you must be a good partner mentally first. Assume the best in others to bring it out." },

Key Point: You can choose happiness by consistently thinking happy, positive thoughts, regardless of your circumstances." },
                { title: "16. Your Subconscious Mind and Harmonious Human Relations", content: "Definition: The Golden Rule is a psychological law: as you would that men should think about you, think you about them in the same way.
