    <!-- Chosen Palette: Maycomb Serenity -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is designed as a single-page app with a fixed sidebar navigation for non-linear exploration. This structure is superior to a linear document as it allows users to jump directly to topics of interest—characters, themes, or plot—facilitating study and comparison. Key interactions include a character deep-dive panel, an interactive relationship map, and clickable theme cards. This user-centric design transforms a static analysis into an engaging exploratory tool, catering to both casual readers and students. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        1. Character Focus: Bar Chart (Chart.js) -> Goal: Compare -> Interaction: Hover for details -> Justification: To visually represent the narrative shift and character importance between the two parts of the book, offering a quantitative insight not obvious from reading alone.
        2. Character Relationships: HTML/CSS Diagram -> Goal: Organize/Relationships -> Interaction: Static visual reference -> Justification: To provide a clear, at-a-glance understanding of the key social dynamics in Maycomb. This method is lightweight, responsive, and avoids complex libraries for a straightforward diagram.
        3. Thematic Exploration: Interactive Cards -> Goal: Explore -> Interaction: Click to reveal details -> Justification: To present complex themes in a digestible, user-initiated manner, reducing initial information overload and encouraging focused reading.
        4. Plot Summary: Timeline -> Goal: Organize -> Interaction: Click to highlight stages -> Justification: To structure the narrative flow visually and help users easily locate key plot points.

                        Set in the racially charged atmosphere of 1930s Alabama, "To Kill a Mockingbird" is told through the eyes of six-year-old Scout Finch. She watches her widowed father, the principled lawyer Atticus Finch, defend a black man falsely accused of raping a white woman. As the trial exposes the town's deep-seated prejudice, Scout and her brother Jem learn complex lessons about justice, prejudice, and the loss of innocence. The story is a powerful exploration of moral courage and the struggle to understand the good and evil within one's own community.

                        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">The first part of the novel establishes the world of Maycomb, Alabama, through the eyes of young Scout Finch. Her life is filled with childhood adventures with her older brother, Jem, and their friend, Dill. The children are fascinated and terrified by their reclusive neighbor, Boo Radley, and spend their summers trying to lure him out. The inciting incident of their childhood narrative is their growing obsession with Boo, which represents their initial encounter with the unknown and the town's hidden stories. This section is characterized by a nostalgic tone, capturing the innocence of childhood against the backdrop of the Great Depression. The rising action begins as Atticus agrees to defend Tom Robinson, slowly pulling the children from their innocent world into the adult realities of prejudice and social injustice.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><span class="font-bold">Climax:</span> The trial of Tom Robinson forms the novel's central climax. Despite Atticus presenting irrefutable evidence that Tom is innocent and that the accuser, Mayella Ewell, was likely abused by her own father, Bob Ewell, the all-white jury convicts Tom purely because of his race. This event shatters Jem's faith in justice and marks a significant loss of innocence for the children.</p>
                        <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><span class="font-bold">Falling Action:</span> In the aftermath, the town's tensions escalate. Tom Robinson is shot and killed while trying to escape from prison. Bob Ewell, humiliated by the trial, seeks revenge on Atticus. He spits in Atticus's face, harasses Tom's widow, and ultimately attacks Jem and Scout on their way home from a Halloween pageant.</p>
                        <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><span class="font-bold">Resolution:</span> As Bob Ewell attacks the children, they are saved by a mysterious figure who turns out to be Boo Radley. In the struggle, Ewell is killed. The sheriff, Heck Tate, realizes Boo killed Ewell to protect the children and decides to report that Ewell fell on his own knife to protect the intensely private Boo from the public eye. Scout finally meets Boo, seeing him not as a monster, but as a human being and a protector. The novel concludes with Scout standing on the Radley porch, seeing the world from Boo's perspective and understanding her father's lesson about empathy. </p>

                        <p class="text-gray-700">This is the novel's central theme. The trial of Tom Robinson is the most potent example, where clear evidence is ignored in favor of racial bias. However, prejudice also exists along class lines, as seen in the town's contempt for the poor but proud Cunninghams and the "white trash" Ewells. The children's initial fear of Boo Radley is also a form of prejudice, born from gossip and ignorance.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-700">Scout, Jem, and Dill begin the story in a world of games and superstitions. The trial forces them to confront the adult world's ugliness. Jem is particularly devastated by the verdict, his idealistic view of justice shattered. The "mockingbird" symbolizes innocence; characters like Tom Robinson and Boo Radley are harmless individuals who are destroyed or threatened by the evil of others. Atticus's warning that "it's a sin to kill a mockingbird" is a plea to protect the innocent.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-700">Atticus Finch is the novel's embodiment of moral courage. He tells Jem that courage isn't "a man with a gun in his hand," but "knowing you're licked before you begin but you begin anyway and you see it through no matter what." He demonstrates this by defending Tom Robinson, knowing it will make him and his family outcasts. Mrs. Dubose, battling her morphine addiction, and Boo Radley, overcoming his reclusiveness to save the children, also display this form of profound courage.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Harper Lee's style is a masterful blend of simple, direct prose and rich, evocative language. The narrative is filtered through the perspective of a child (a retrospective narration by an adult Scout), which allows for both charming innocence and sharp, unintentional irony. Lee uses colloquial Southern dialect to ground the story in its setting, and her use of foreshadowing (e.g., the warnings about Bob Ewell) builds suspense. The tone shifts seamlessly from lighthearted and humorous in the early chapters to tense and somber during the trial and its aftermath.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">The novel begins with Scout's innocent, self-contained world, defined by summer games, schoolyard squabbles, and a superstitious fear of Boo Radley. The central catalyst for her growth is the Tom Robinson trial. Witnessing the profound injustice of the verdict and the hatred it unleashes forces Scout and Jem to confront the harsh realities of their society. Their childhood certainties are replaced by a more complex understanding of morality, where good and evil are not always clear-cut.</p>

Scout's journey is marked by her gradual ability to grasp his teachings. Her initial impulse is to solve problems with her fists, but she slowly learns the value of restraint and empathy. The novel's final scene, where Scout stands on the Radley porch and sees the town from Boo's perspective, is the culmination of her moral development. She has, at last, learned to "climb into his skin and walk around in it," fulfilling her father's most important lesson.</p>

Atticus and Miss Maudie explain to the children that it is a sin to kill a mockingbird because they are harmless creatures that only bring beauty into the world.</p>

He is a kind, gentle man who makes the mistake of feeling sorry for a white woman, Mayella Ewell. His only "crime" is to exist as a black man in a racist society. The community's prejudice ultimately leads to his wrongful conviction and death, a senseless destruction of an innocent life.</p>

The town, through gossip and fear, turns him into a monster. In reality, he is a shy, kind man who watches over the Finch children and ultimately saves their lives. To expose him to public scrutiny for killing Bob Ewell would be, as Scout understands, "sort of like shootin' a mockingbird."</p>

                 <p class="text-gray-600 mb-8 leading-relaxed max-w-3xl">Maycomb, Alabama, is more than just a backdrop for the story; it is a character in its own right.

                        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Maycomb is a town of polite, church-going people who are also deeply prejudiced. It is a place where "a day was twenty-four hours long but seemed longer," moving slowly and resistant to change. This inertia allows traditions of racism and classism to persist unchallenged. The characters are all products of this environment, either conforming to its unwritten rules (like most of the townspeople), challenging them (like Atticus), or being crushed by them (like Tom Robinson).</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">The town has a strict social order. The established white families like the Finches are at the top, followed by the townspeople, the poor but respectable farmers like the Cunninghams, the "white trash" Ewells, and finally, the black community. This rigid structure is the source of much of the novel's conflict. The trial is so explosive because it threatens this order by pitting a black man's word against a white woman's, something Maycomb's social code cannot tolerate.</p>

                <p class="text-gray-600 mb-8 leading-relaxed max-w-3xl">The novel presents a powerful critique of the American legal system, exploring the gap between the law as an ideal and justice as it is practiced in a prejudiced society.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Atticus believes in the courtroom as "the one place where a man ought to get a square deal." He presents a brilliant, logical defense based on evidence. However, the trial proves that the jury's courtroom is governed not by law, but by the unwritten codes of the community. The jury convicts Tom not because they believe he is guilty, but because they cannot bring themselves to acquit a black man accused by a white woman. The novel thus shows how legal institutions can fail when the individuals within them are corrupted by prejudice.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">In the end, the novel suggests that true justice is not always delivered in a courtroom. Bob Ewell escapes legal punishment for his actions, but he meets a form of karmic justice at the hands of Boo Radley. Sheriff Heck Tate's decision to protect Boo by fabricating a story is technically an obstruction of the law. However, in this case, it serves a higher moral justice by protecting an innocent man. This act demonstrates that sometimes, individual conscience and empathy must override the rigid application of the law.</p>

                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Nelle Harper Lee was born and raised in Monroeville, Alabama, the town that would become the inspiration for Maycomb. Like Atticus Finch, her father was a lawyer who served in the state legislature. Lee was a precocious child and a close friend of the writer Truman Capote, who served as the inspiration for the character Dill. She studied law but left before completing her degree to pursue a writing career in New York City.</p>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 mt-4 leading-relaxed">After the monumental success of "To Kill a Mockingbird," Lee retreated from public life, granting very few interviews and publishing no other books for over half a century.

                        <p class="text-gray-700">In 2015, the literary world was stunned by the publication of "Go Set a Watchman." The novel was presented as a sequel to "Mockingbird" but was actually an earlier draft. It features an adult Scout returning to Maycomb to visit an aging Atticus, who is portrayed as a segregationist with racist views. The publication was controversial, with many readers distressed by this different portrayal of Atticus and questions raised about whether the elderly Lee had fully consented to its release. "Watchman" provides fascinating insight into Lee's creative process but is generally considered a less polished work than the novel it preceded.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Harper Lee grew up in Monroeville, Alabama, which served as the model for Maycomb. Her father was a lawyer who once defended two black men accused of murder. The story is also deeply influenced by the infamous Scottsboro Boys trials of the 1930s, where nine black teenagers were falsely accused of raping two white women. Lee wrote the novel in the mid-1950s but it was published in 1960, at the height of the Civil Rights Movement. Its release coincided with landmark events like the Montgomery Bus Boycott and the integration of schools, making its themes of racial injustice incredibly timely and resonant.</p>

            arc: "Scout begins the story as a naive and innocent child. Through the trial and her experiences with Boo Radley, she loses her innocence but gains a deep sense of empathy and a more mature understanding of human nature's capacity for both good and evil.",

            arc: "Atticus is a largely static character, representing a consistent moral compass throughout the novel. His 'arc' is less about personal change and more about how his unwavering principles are tested by the trial and its aftermath. He remains the moral backbone of the story.",

            arc: "Jem's arc is a classic coming-of-age story. He starts as Scout's playmate but matures significantly. The trial's unjust verdict deeply disillusion's him, shattering his childhood idealism. He ends the novel more cynical but with a more realistic and nuanced view of the world.",

            arc: "Boo's arc happens almost entirely in the town's imagination. He transforms from a monstrous figure of rumor into a quiet, vulnerable, and heroic human being. His development is in the children's perception of him, culminating when Scout finally sees him for who he is: a gentle soul and a 'mockingbird'.",
