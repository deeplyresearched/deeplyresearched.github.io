    <!-- Chosen Palette: Zen Garden -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is structured thematically rather than mirroring the book's chapters. This design prioritizes user engagement and exploration. It starts with the core concept (the Ikigai Venn diagram), making it the central interactive element. Subsequent sections delve into practical applications like the '10 Rules' and 'Longevity Secrets', presented as digestible, interactive modules (cards and a dashboard). This non-linear structure allows users to explore the concepts that interest them most, fostering a deeper understanding of how the principles connect. The goal is to transform a passive reading experience into an active journey of discovery. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Report Info: Core Ikigai concept -> Goal: Organize & Inform -> Viz/Presentation: Interactive Venn Diagram (HTML/CSS) -> Interaction: Click on circles/intersections to update a detailed text panel -> Justification: Visually represents the book's central framework and makes it explorable.
        - Report Info: The 10 rules of Ikigai -> Goal: Inform & Organize -> Viz/Presentation: Interactive Card Grid (HTML/Tailwind) -> Interaction: Click to reveal detailed descriptions for each rule -> Justification: Breaks down the core tenets into memorable, bite-sized pieces, encouraging focused engagement.
        - Report Info: Okinawan Diet Principles -> Goal: Inform & Compare -> Viz/Presentation: Donut Chart (Chart.js/Canvas) -> Interaction: Hover for tooltips on food group proportions -> Justification: A donut chart effectively visualizes the proportional balance of the diet, making the concept of 'eating the rainbow' immediately understandable.
        - Report Info: Concept of 'Flow' -> Goal: Inform -> Viz/Presentation: A structured list with an adjacent content panel -> Interaction: Clicking a principle updates the panel with a detailed explanation -> Justification: This interactive list format allows for a clean overview while providing depth on demand, explaining a complex psychological state clearly. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->

            <p class="max-w-3xl mx-auto text-lg text-stone-600">
                "Ikigai" by Francesc Miralles and Héctor García explores the Japanese concept of a 'reason for being.' It's an investigation into the lifestyles of the world's longest-living people, particularly in Okinawa, to uncover the secrets to a joyful, purposeful, and healthy life. This interactive guide breaks down the core principles of the book.

                    Ikigai is the intersection of four fundamental elements of life: what you love, what you are good at, what the world needs, and what you can be paid for. Finding your Ikigai is about finding a state of balance and purpose. Click on the different parts of the diagram below to explore each component and their powerful intersections.

                    "Flow" is the state of being completely immersed and energized by an activity. It's when you are so absorbed that you lose track of time. The book argues that our happiest moments are often when we are in a state of flow, which is closely linked to our ikigai. Below are the key conditions to achieve it.
